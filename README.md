# About Joseph Rotblat

**Joseph Rotblat** was a peace activist who fought against the military use of nuclear technology. However, he supported the use of this technology for peaceful purposes such as electricity generation, healthcare, and reducing dependence on oil and gas.


# About the Project 


**Joseph Rotblat App** is an application I created as a school project about a peacekeeper. I chose Joseph Rotblat because I believe he is one of the best examples for this kind of project. I also decided to make it an app so it can inspire future generations and encourage schools to modernize by using modern tools for learning. Combining technology with education can significantly improve students’ learning levels.
